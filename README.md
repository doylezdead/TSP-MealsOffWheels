# TSP-MealsOffWheels
Autonomous drone flight path planning via client app and server app

1. Team Name - 
   Meals Off Wheels

2. A list of your team members (so I don't have to look them up), and which team member is assuming the role of Scrum Master - 
   Ryan Doyle (Scrum Master)
   Mitchell Anderson
   David Morhardt
   Eric Kosovec
   Zhen Piao

3. A general description of your project - 
    Our project will be focuesd around a drone flight-path mapping system. There will be a client application (phone app) as well as a server application that will run on the "home base" of the drone.  The client will be able to send gps coordinates to have the drone fly a route too the location and drop off a payload(food in this case).  The route would be plotted on a map including obstacles and the map would be displayed on both the client and server apps. There will also be conditions on if the destination is unreachable du to any reason and error handling with the drone based off of sensors and such.  

4. Why did you pick this project? - 
    Mitchell had a very in depth description of a complete software and hardware system for a drone from a project design class of his.  While it was a very good project, it did not fall under the size scope of this class. It was also too vague in how the physical drone system would be laid out.  During our first group meeting, we whittled that plan down to a very accomplishable project for only a subsystem of the drone.

5. What programming language(s) does the project use? - 
    It will be done in java due to the flexibility and our team's knowledge.  We also chose this in favor of doing an android application as the client program.

6. What technologies are involved? GUI, database, networking, audio, etc. - 
    Networking and the GUI's for displaying the maps will be our biggest involved technologies.  Another technology that will have to be included is interfacing with the phone's gps via android in order to send raw gps coordinates.
